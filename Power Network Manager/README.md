# Power Network Manager
The goal for this mod is to provide a way to visualize the power generation/consumption for a selected network.

## How To Use
Click on any Power Node (e.g. Tesla Tower, Wireless power tower, Satellite substation), click on the embedded button, and then the GUI will display the power statistics for the network.
