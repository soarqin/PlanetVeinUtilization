# Planet Vein Utilization
While either on a planet or having one selected, you can then open the Planet View (default key "M") to view its current resources. This mod will add the number of veins currently being mined on, over the total number of veins.

For example, it could show a planet having 15 total iron veins, while only having 10 being mined on as "Iron:  10/15".
